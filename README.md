# OLA Ride Booking Analysis with SQL

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: OLA Ride Booking Analysis with SQL    
**Database**: `Bookings`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a Bookings database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a OLA database**: Create and populate a OLA database with the provided Bookings data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.



## Findings

- **Booking Success and Cancellations**: The majority of rides were successfully completed, but customer cancellations accounted for 12% of total bookings, while 
                                         driver cancellations contributed to 8%.
- **Payment Preferences**: Cash payments accounted for 60% of total transactions, surpassing online payments (40%), indicating a strong customer preference for 
                           cash over digital payment modes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Prime Sedan bookings recorded a maximum driver rating of 5 and a minimum rating of 3.2, highlighting room for service improvement.
- **Customer and Driver Challenges**: Driver-related cancellations (due to personal and car issues) accounted for 5% of incomplete rides, affecting overall reliability.


## Conclusion

This SQL project provides key insights for OLA's ride-hailing services, identifying growth areas like driver reliability and customer retention. Payment trends and ride value analysis reveal opportunities to improve efficiency and revenue. It showcases SQL skills in advanced queries, aggregations, and data-driven decision-making for a Data Analyst role.
